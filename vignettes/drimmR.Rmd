# Introduction

In this work we focus on multi-state systems modeled by means of a
particular class of non-homogeneous Markov processes introduced in
**@Ver08**, called drifting Markov processes. Most of the estimation methods
and reliability results are developed in **@BaVe2018**.

Note that in many mathematical models it is assumed the homogeneity with
respect to time, which is inappropriate in most of the applications.
But, considering general non-homogeneous processes could be unrealistic
from a practical point of view. For this reason, the drifting Markov
chains assume that the Markov transition matrix
is a linear/polynomial function of two/several Markov transition
matrices. Thus we obtain a "smooth" non-homogeneity, with sensibly less
parameters than in the general case.

Few R packages have been developed to handle similar types of models of
Markov, semi-Markov or hidden semi-Markov type, useful in reliability or
DNA analysis. For semi-Markov models we have `semiMarkov` `R` package
**@krol_semimarkov_2015** that performs maximum likelihood estimation for
parametric continuous-time semi-Markov processes, `smm` `R` package
**@BaBeCeSaVe** which performs parametric and non-parametric estimation
and simulation for multi-state discrete-time semi-Markov processes. Two
`R` packages are also dedicated to hidden semi-Markov models,
implementing estimation and prediction methods: the `hsmm` `R` package
**@bulla_hsmm_2010** and the `mhsmm` `R` package **@oconnell_hidden_2011**.

Note that there is no `R` package developed for drifting Markov models
(DMMs). Thus the purpose of this paper is to present an `R` package that
we have developed, called `drimmR`, which performs estimation and
simulation for such models, as well as the estimation of associated
reliability measures. The aim of this paper is to describe the different
possibilities of this package. To summarize, the package `drimmR` that
we present deals with different problems:

-   We consider one or several sample paths; for several sample paths,
    two estimation methods are proposed: one is the usual LSE, the other
    one is the average of LSEs obtained on each sample;

-   The samples paths are complete or incomplete;

-   The sample paths come from drifting Markov chains that are of the
    same length or of different lengths (between the same Markov
    transition probability matrices);

-   We derive exact computations of reliability/survival analysis
    measures (reliability or survival function, availability,
    maintainability, failure rates);

-   We compute the probabilities of appearance of a word in a given
    sequence under a given model.

We would like to mention that a web interface called `WebDRIMM` has been
also developed [cf. **@web2018**] for simulating and estimating drifting
Markov models, as well as associated reliability indicators; it is
available at `http://bioinfo.univ-rouen.fr/WebDRIMM`\
The paper is organized as follows. Section
[2](#section_DMM){reference-type="ref" reference="section_DMM"}
describes the drifting Markov models used in this package, present
associated reliability indicators and corresponding estimation results
and techniques. Section [3](#section_package){reference-type="ref"
reference="section_package"} illustrates the different functions of the
`drimmR` package and we end the paper by presenting some concluding
remarks on this `R` package in
Section [4](#concluding){reference-type="ref" reference="concluding"}.

# Drifting Markov models, estimation and associated reliability measures {#section_DMM}

Let us consider a random system with finite state space
$E=\{1,\ldots, s\}$, $s < \infty.$ We assume that the time evolution of
a system is governed by a discrete-time stochastic process with values
in $E.$ In the following we will introduce a class of processes
according to **@Ver08** in Section
[2.1](#subsection_DMM){reference-type="ref" reference="subsection_DMM"},
we will briefly present associated reliability indicators according to
**@BaVe2018** in Section [2.2](#subsection_rel){reference-type="ref"
reference="subsection_rel"} and estimation of the parameters in Section
[2.3](#subsection_estimation){reference-type="ref"
reference="subsection_estimation"}, according to **@Ver08** **@BaVe2018**.

## Drifting Markov models {#subsection_DMM}

Let $\boldsymbol{\Pi}_0 = (\Pi_0(u, v))_{u,v \in E}$ and
$\boldsymbol{\Pi}_1 = (\Pi_1(u, v))_{u,v \in E}$ be two Markov transition
matrices of order 1 over the state space $E.$

::: {#def_DriftLin .definition}
**Definition 1** (linear drifting Markov chain of order $1$ and of
length $n$). *A sequence $X_0,$ $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ with state space
$E=\mathbb \{1, 2, \ldots, s\}$ is said to be a *linear drifting Markov
chain (of order 1)* of length $n$ between the Markov transition matrices
$\boldsymbol{\Pi}_0$ and $\boldsymbol{\Pi}_1$ if the distribution of $X_t,$
$t = 1, \ldots, n,$ is defined by $$\label{eq_DriftLin1}
\mathbb P(X_t=v \mid X_{t-1}    = u, X_{t-2}, \ldots ) = \Pi_{\frac{t}{n}}(u, v), \; u, v \in E,$$
where $$\label{eq_DriftLin2}
\Pi_{\frac{t}{n}}(u, v) = \left( 1 - \frac{t}{n} \right) \Pi_0(u, v) + \frac{t}{n} \Pi_1(u, v), \; u, v \in E.$$*
:::

Let us denote by $\boldsymbol{\alpha} = (\alpha(1), \ldots, \alpha(s))$ the
*initial distribution of the chain*, that is the distribution of $X_0,$
$\alpha(u)=\mathbb P (X_0 = u)$ for any state $u\in E.$

The *linear drifting Markov model* of order $1$ can be generalized to
*polynomial drifting Markov model* of order $k$ and degree $d$. Let
$\boldsymbol{\Pi}_{\frac{i}{d}} = (\boldsymbol{\Pi}_{\frac{i}{d}}(u_1, \dots, u_k, v))_{u_1, \dots, u_k,v \in E}$
be $d$ Markov transition matrices (of order $k$) over a state space $E.$

::: {#def_DriftPol .definition}
**Definition 2** (polynomial drifting Markov chain of order $k$ and of
length $n$). *A sequence $X_0,$ $X_1,$ $\ldots,$ $X_n$ with state space
$E=\mathbb \{1, 2, \ldots, s\}$ is said to be a *polynomial drifting
Markov chain of order k* and of length $n$ if the distribution of $X_t,$
$t = 1, \ldots, n,$ is defined by $$\label{eq_DriftPol1}
\mathbb P(X_t=v \mid X_{t-1}    = u_k, X_{t-2}=u_{k-1}, \ldots ) = \boldsymbol{\Pi}_{\frac{t}{n}}(u_1, \dots, u_k, v), \; u_1, \dots, u_k, v \in E,$$
where $$\label{eq_DriftPol2}
\boldsymbol{\Pi}_{\frac{t}{n}}(u_1, \dots, u_k, v) = \displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^d A_i(t)\boldsymbol{\Pi}_{\frac{i}{d}}(u_1, \dots, u_k,v), \; u_1, \dots, u_k, v \in E,$$
with $A_i$ polynomials of degree $d$ such as, for any
$i, j \in \{0, 1, \ldots, d\},$ $A_i\left(\frac{nj}{d}\right)=\mathbb{1}_{\{i=j\}}.$*
:::

We would like to stress that the coherence between notations implies the
choice of the notation $\boldsymbol{\Pi}_{\frac{i}{d}}$ and that, in fact, $A_i$
are Lagrange polynomials; see @Ver08 for more details on these two
points.

## Reliability of drifting Markov models {#subsection_rel}

In order to undertake a reliability analysis of a system modeled by a
DMM, let us assume that the state space of the system is partitioned
into working and failure states, $E=U \cup D,$ with
$U \cap D=\emptyset,$ where $U=\{1,\ldots,s_1\}$ represents the working
states and $D=\{s_1+1,\ldots,s\}$ the failure states of the system.
According to this partition of the state space we partition any matrix
of vector we are working with and we denote the corresponding partitions
accordingly (e.g., $\boldsymbol{\Pi}_0^{UU},$ $\boldsymbol{\Pi}_0^{DU},$
$\boldsymbol{\alpha}^{U}$ etc.).

questions in a discrete-time semi-Markov framework.

## Estimation of drifting Markov models {#subsection_estimation}

In this section we will consider different types of data for which the
estimators of the characteristics of a drifting Markov chain and of the
associated reliability indicators will be derived.

One can observe one sample path, that will be denoted by
${\mathcal H}(m,n):= (X_0,X_1, \ldots,X_{m}),$ where $m$ denotes the
length of the sample path and $n$ the length of the drifting Markov
chain. Two cases can be considered: (a1) $m=n$ (a complete sample path);
(a2) $m < n$ (an incomplete sample path).

One can also observe $H$ i.i.d. sample paths,
${\mathcal H}_i(m_i,n_i), i=1, \ldots, H.$ Four cases can be considered
here: (b1) $m_i=n_i=n$ for all $i=1, \ldots, H$ (complete sample paths
of drifting Markov chains of the same length) ; (b2) $n_i=n$ for all
$i=1, \ldots, H$ (incomplete sample paths of drifting Markov chains of
the same length); (b3) $m_i=n_i$ for all $i=1, \ldots, H$ (complete
sample paths of drifting Markov chains of different lengths) ; (b4)
$m_i \leq n_i$ for all $i=1, \ldots, H$ (incomplete sample paths of
drifting Markov chains of different lengths).

We have developed cf. **@Ver08**; **@BaVe2018** mean square estimators
starting from data under these frameworks; we present here only the case
of a linear drifting Markov chain of order $1$ under the sample
framework (b1) (complete sample paths of drifting Markov chains of the
same length).

::: proposition
[]{#prop_B1 label="prop_B1"} Under the setting (b1), starting with $H$
complete sample paths of drifting Markov chains of the same length of a
linear drifting Markov chain between two Markov transition matrices (of
order 1) $\boldsymbol{\Pi}_0$ and $\boldsymbol{\Pi}_1,$ for any states $u, v \in E,$ the
estimators of $\Pi_0(u,v)$ and $\Pi_1(u,v)$ are given by:

$$\begin{aligned}
&&\widehat{\Pi}_{0; (n,H)} (u,v) = \frac{P_1(H, \boldsymbol{m}, \boldsymbol{n}) P_2(H, \boldsymbol{m}, \boldsymbol{n}) - P_3(H, \boldsymbol{m}, \boldsymbol{n})P_4(H, \boldsymbol{m}, \boldsymbol{n})}

{P_5(H, \boldsymbol{m}, \boldsymbol{n})P_1(H, \boldsymbol{m}, \boldsymbol{n}) - P_3(H, \boldsymbol{m}, \boldsymbol{n})^2},\end{aligned}$$

where we have introduced the following notation:\

::: small
$\displaystyle P_1(H, \boldsymbol{m}, \boldsymbol{n}) = \sum_{t=1}^{m}\sum_{h=1}^H \mathbb{1}_{\{X_{t-1}^h=u \}} \left(\frac{t}{n}\right)^2,$
$\displaystyle P_2(H, \boldsymbol{m}, \boldsymbol{n}) = \sum_{t=1}^{m} \sum_{h=1}^H\mathbb{1}_{\{X_{t-1}^h=u, X_t^h=v \}} \left(1-\frac{t}{n}\right),$\
$\displaystyle P_3(H, \boldsymbol{m}, \boldsymbol{n}) = \sum_{t=1}^{m}\sum_{h=1}^H\mathbb{1}_{\{X_{t-1}^h=u \}} \left(1-\frac{t}{n}\right)\left(\frac{t}{n}\right),$
$\displaystyle  P_4(H, \boldsymbol{m}, \boldsymbol{n}) = \sum_{t=1}^{m}\sum_{h=1}^H\mathbb{1}_{\{X_{t-1}^h=u, X_t^h=v \}}\left(\frac{t}{n}\right),$\
$\displaystyle  P_5(H, \boldsymbol{m}, \boldsymbol{n}) = \displaystyle\sum_{t=1}^{m}\sum_{h=1}^H\mathbb{1}_{\{X_{t-1}^h=u \}}\left(1-\frac{t}{n}\right)^2,$
with $\boldsymbol{m}=(m_1, \ldots, m_H)$ and $\boldsymbol{n}=(n_1, \ldots, n_H).$
:::
:::

Note we can adapt the estimation procedures that we have previously
obtained in order to get estimators of the drifting Markov models in the
other cases; one can see **@BaVe2018** for more details. Using the
expression of the reliability indicators of a drifting Markov chain
previously obtained and the estimators of the characteristics of a
drifting Markov chain, one immediately obtains the associated plug-in
estimators of the reliability metrics.

# The package {#section_package}

The package is principally devoted to the simulation and estimation of
drifting Markov models, as well as to the estimation of associated
reliability measures and to the computation of the probabilities of a
word occurrence under a given model. All the different possibilities of
the package are illustrated in Figure [2](#fig){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig"}.

## Estimation of drifting Markov models {#subsection_pack_estim}

The estimation of DMMs is carried out by the functions `fitdmm`, when
starting from one (several) sample path (and obtain LSE). We will
describe this function in the sequel.

1.  The function `fitdmm`

The different **arguments** of this function are:

-   `sequences`: A list of character vector(s) representing one
    (several) sequence(s) from which the estimation is carried out

-   `order`: Order of the Markov chain

-   `degree`: Degree of the polynomials (e.g., linear drifting if
    degree=1, etc.)

-   `states`: Vector of states space of length s \> 1

-   `init.estim`: Method used to estimate the initial law.

Here we have an example of an estimation of a drifting Markov model of
order 1 and degree 1 using the function `fitdmm`, starting from a DNA
sequence called `lambda`.

```{r}
data(lambda, package = "drimmR")
states <- c("a","c","g","t")
dmm <- fitdmm(lambda, 1, 1, states, init.estim="freq", fit.method="sum")
dmm
```

### Estimation of corresponding model characteristics {#subsection_pack_charact}

Once a Markov drifting model has been estimated/constructed as described
in the previous subsection, various characteristics of the model can be
computed. These are: the log-likelihood of one or several sequences, the
AIC and BIC information criteria, the stationary distribution on an
entire sequence or only on a part of it, the distribution of the chain
on the entire sequence or only on a part of it.

The functions `loglik`, `aic` and `bic` have the following
**arguments**:

-   `x`: Object of class `dmm`

-   `sequences`: A list of character vector(s) representing one
    (several) sequence(s)

They return the numerical values of the log-likelihood, the AIC, the BIC
of the sequence, respectively.


```{r}
data(lambda, package = "drimmR")
sequence <- c("a","g","g","t","c","g","a","t","a","a","a")
dmm <-fitdmm(lambda, 1, 1, c('a','c','g','t'), init.estim = "freq")

loglik(dmm, sequence)

aic(dmm, sequence)

bic(dmm, sequence)
```

The function `getTransitionMatrix` evaluates the transition matrix at a
given position. The function has the following arguments :

-   `x`: Object of class `dmm`

-   `pos`: position along the sequence (integer)

```{r}
data(lambda)
dmm <- fitdmm(lambda, 1, 1, c('a','c','g','t'),init.estim = "freq")
t <- 10
getTransitionMatrix(dmm,pos=t)
```

The function `getStationaryLaw` evaluates the stationary law at a given
position or for all positions along the list of sequence(s).

-   `x`: Object of class `dmm`

-   `pos`: position along the sequence (integer)

-   `all.pos`: FALSE (default, evaluation at pos index) ; TRUE
    (evaluation for all pos index)

-   `internal`: FALSE (default) ; TRUE (for internal use of fitdmm
    initial law)

```{r}
data(lambda, package = "drimmR")
sequence <- sample(lambda, 30, replace=TRUE )
dmm <- fitdmm(sequence, 1, 1, c('a','c','g','t'), init.estim = "freq")
t <- 10
getStationaryLaw(dmm,pos=t)
getStationaryLaw(dmm,all.pos=TRUE)
```

### Analysis of a model {#subsection_pack_analysis}

Once a Markov drifting model has been estimated/constructed as described
at the beginning of this section, the obtained model can be analyzed by
means of several functions.\

1.  The computation of word probabilities according to an
    estimated/constructed DMM is carried out by means of the functions
    `word_probability`, `word_probabilities` and `words_probabilities`.

The function `word_probability` computes the probability of a word at a given
position; it has the following **arguments**:

-   `word`: A word, i.e., a subsequence string of characters

-   `pos`: A position of the word along the sequence (numeric)

-   `x`: An object of class `dmm`

-   `output_file`: A file containing the probability

-   `internal`: FALSE (default) ; TRUE (for internal use of word
    applications)

It returns the numerical value of the probability.\

```{r}
data(lambda, package = "drimmR")
dmm <- fitdmm(lambda, 1, 1, c('a','c','g','t'), init.estim = "freq")
word_probability("cgt",10,dmm,output_file="file.txt")
```

The function `word_probabilities` computes the probabilities of a word at given
positions. It has the following **arguments**:

-   `word`: A word, i.e., a subsequence string of characters

-   `pos`: Vector of integer positions of the word along the sequence;
    it is given by a `start` and `end` point

-   `x`: An object of class `dmm`

-   `output_file`: A file containing the probabilities

-   `internal`: FALSE (default) ; TRUE (for internal use of word
    applications)

-   `plot`: display a figure plot of word probabilities along the
    positions if TRUE

It returns a numerical vector of probabilities computed at the positions
given in `pos`.\

```{r}
data(lambda, package = "drimmR")
dmm <- fitdmm(lambda, 1, 1, c('a','c','g','t'), init.estim = "freq", fit.method="sum")
res <- word_probabilities("cgt", c(100, length(lambda)-3), dmm, output_file="file.txt", plot=TRUE)
head(res[[1]], n=10)
res[2]
```

The function `words_probabilities` computes the probabilities of a word at
given positions; it has the following **arguments**:

-   `words`: A vector of characters containing words

-   `pos`: Vector of integer positions of the word along the sequence;
    it is given by a `start` and `end` point

-   `x`: An object of class `dmm`

-   `output_file`: A file containing the matrix of probabilities

-   `plot`: display a figure plot of word probabilities along the
    positions if TRUE

It returns a data frame of probabilities computed for each element of
`words` at the positions given in `pos`.\

```
data(lambda, package = "drimmR")
dmm <- fitdmm(lambda, 1, 1, c('a','c','g','t'), init.estim = "freq")
res <- words_probabilities(c("atcgattc", "taggct", "ggatcgg"), c(100, length(lambda)-8), dmm, output_file="file.txt", plot=TRUE)
head(res[[1]], n=10)
res[2]
```

1.  The function `lengthWord_probabilities` computes the probabilities of
    occurrence of the observed word of given size in a sequence at
    several positions. This function has the following **arguments**:

-   `n`: Integer, the given length of the word

-   `sequence`: Vector of characters representing the sequence

-   `pos`: Vector of integer positions of the word along the sequence.
    It it is given by a `start` and `end` point

-   `x`: An object of class `dmm`

-   `output_file` A file containing the vector of probabilities

-   `plot` display several figure plots of probabilities of appearance
    of words along the positions if TRUE

It returns a data frame of probability by position\

```{r}
data(lambda, package = "drimmR")
dmm <- fitdmm(lambda, 1, 1, c('a','c','g','t'), init.estim = "freq")
res <- lengthWord_probabilities(2, lambda, c(100, length(lambda)-2), dmm, output_file="file.txt", plot=TRUE)
res[2]
```

## Simulation of drifting Markov models {#subsection_pack_simul}

The simulation of drifting Markov models is carried out by the function
`simulation` that has the following **arguments**:

-   `DRIMM`: An object of class `dmm`

-   `output_file`: File containing the simulated sequence

-   `model_size`: Integer, the size of the model

```{r}
data(lambda, package = "drimmR")
dmm <- fitdmm(lambda, 1, 1, c('a','c','g','t'), init.estim = "freq")
# simulate a sequence of length 20 000 from dmm
simulate(dmm, "file.txt", 20000)
```

## Reliability of drifting Markov models {#subsection_pack_reliab}

The reliability measures are computed by means of the following
functions: `A` (availability), `R` (reliability,survival function), `M`
(maintainability), `errorRate` (the classical failure rate, called
BMP-failure rate and a more recent failure rate adapted to discrete
data, called RG-failure rate). For more details on these reliability
measures one can see **@Bar2004b**; **@Bar2008b**. All these functions have
the following **arguments**:

-   `x`: An object of class `dmm`

-   `k1`: An integer, start position for the computation of the
    corresponding reliability measure

-   `k2`: An integer, end position for the computation of the
    corresponding reliability measure

-   `s1`: Character vector of the subspace working states (up-states)
    among the state space vector s.t. s1 \< s

-   `output_file`: File containing the estimated/computed values of the
    corresponding reliability measure at each position of the selected
    frame

-   `plot`: display figure plot of the corresponding reliability measure
    along the positions if TRUE

The function `errorRate` enables to select the type of evaluated failure
rate with an additional argument :

-   `error.rate`: Default=\"BMP\", then BMP-failure-rate is the method
    used to estimate the error rate. If error.rate= \"RG\", then
    RG-failure rate is the method used to estimate the error rate.

These functions return vectors with the values of the corresponding
reliability measure.

### Estimation of reliability {#subsection_pack_reliab}

```{r}
data(lambda, package = "drimmR")
dmm <- fitdmm(lambda, 1, 1, c("a","c","g","t"), init.estim ="freq", fit.method="sum")

# Concluding remarks {#concluding}

To conclude, in this paper we have presented `drimmR`, an `R` package
for simulation, estimation and reliability and survival analysis of
drifting Markov models. These are versatile stochastic models of Markov
type capable of taking into account a time non-homogeneity of a known,
controlled shape. For this reason these models can represent interesting
modeling alternatives to classical models (like Markov models,
semi-Markov models, etc.) and can be useful for researchers,
practitioners and engineers in various fields.

The package addresses several items important from practical point of
view, when carrying out the estimation: we consider one or several
samples, the sample paths can be complete or not, can come from models
of the same length or of different lengths.

The fields of application of the DMMs can be numerous; we only want to
point out three of them.

-   *Survival analysis* and *reliability theory*: note that important
    indicators like reliability or survival function, availability,
    maintainability and failure rates are computed in our package;

-   *Bioinformatics*: note that important quantities for OMICS data in
    general, DNA analysis in particular, are computed by the proposed
    package. Thus we have the computation of the probabilities and
    expectations of appearance of a given word along the sequence.
