#'
#' @description This package performs the estimation, simulation and the exact computation of associated
#' reliability measures of drifting Markov models (DMMs). These are particular non-homogeneous Markov chains
#' for which the Markov transition matrix is a linear (polynomial) function of two (several) Markov transition matrices.
#' Several statistical frameworks are taken into account (one or several samples, complete or incomplete samples, models
#' of the same length). Computation of probabilities of appearance of a word along a sequence
#' under a given model are also considered.
