\usage{
failureRate(
  x,
  k1,
  k2,
  s1,
  failure.rate = c("BMP", "RG"),
  output_file = NULL,
  plot = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class `dmm`}

\item{k1}{Start position :  a positive integer giving the start position along the sequence from which the failure rates of the DMM should be computed}

\item{k2}{End position :  a positive integer giving the end position along the sequence until which the failure rates of the DMM should be computed}

\item{s1}{Character vector of the subspace working states among the state space vector such that s1 < s}

\item{failure.rate}{Default="BMP", then BMP-failure-rate is the method used to estimate the failure rate. If `failure.rate`= "RG",
then RG-failure rate is the method used to estimate the failure rate.}

\item{output_file}{(Optional) A file containing matrix of failure rates at each position (e.g, "C:/.../ER.txt")}

\item{plot}{`FALSE` (no figure plot of failure rates by position); `TRUE` (figure plot)}
}
\value{
A matrix with positions and failure rate scores of states (and figure plot)
}
\description{
Estimation of two different definition of the failure rate : the BMP-failure rate and RG-failure rate.

As for BMP-failure rate, consider a system S starting to work at time \eqn{l = 0}. The BMP-failure rate at time \eqn{l \in N} is
the conditional probability that the failure of the system occurs at time \eqn{l}, given that the system has
worked until time \eqn{l - 1}.

The RG-failure rate is a discrete-time adapted failure-rate proposed by D. Roy and R. Gupta. Classification of discrete
lives. \emph{Microelectronics Reliability}, 32(10):1459â€“1473, 1992.
}
\details{
The BMP-failure rate denoted by \eqn{\lambda(l), l \in N} is usually considered for
continuous time systems.

The RG-failure rate denoted by \eqn{r(l), l \in N} is adapted to work in discrete time systems.
