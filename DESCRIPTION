Title: Drifting Markov Model
Version: 0.2.0
Author: Nicolas VERGNE [aut,cre]
Maintainer: Nicolas Vergne <Nicolas.Vergne@univ-rouen.fr>
Description: This package introduce the drifting Markov models (DMMs) which are 
	inhomogeneous Markov models designed for modeling the heterogeneities of
	sequences in a more <U+FB02>exible way than homogeneous Markov chains or even 
	hidden Markov. In this context, we developed a R package dedicated to 
	the estimation of drifting Markov models.
